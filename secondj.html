        <p>Java is a versatile, <span>object-oriented programming language</span> that is widely used for building platform-independent applications. It was created by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s and has since become one of the most popular programming languages worldwide.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Java allows developers to write code once and run it anywhere, thanks to the <span>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</span>. It is commonly used for building web applications, mobile apps, enterprise-level software, and even games.</p>
        <p>With its robust set of libraries, ease of use, and cross-platform capabilities, Java remains a powerful tool for developers around the world.</p>

    <section class="content">
        <p>One of the key features of Java is its security model. Java's built-in security features, such as the ability to run code in a "sandbox" environment, make it ideal for building secure applications. Its rich API (Application Programming Interface) provides extensive support for networking, database connectivity, and graphical user interfaces, enabling developers to create complex applications efficiently.</p>
